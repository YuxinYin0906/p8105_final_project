## Tentative Project Title

## Motivation for this project

The airline industry is highly dependent on timely flight operations, and flight delays are a common concern for both passengers and airlines. Weather conditions often play a big role in causing delays. In this project, we aim to investigate the relationship between weather and flight delays using historical flight data from 2013. By understanding the data patterns, we would build a prediction model to predict flight delays based on variables including but not limited to carriers, airports, weather, etc. We would also assess if the insights gained from 2013 data can be applied to 2023, which is ten years later.

## Intended final products

## Anticipated data sources

## Planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

##### Planned analyses

##### Planned visualizations

##### Planned coding challenges

Given the original dataset `flights` we will employ is a huge dataset with 336,776 entries, one of the biggest coding challenges we will encounter is how to, without bias, get the dataset down to a size that is suitable for use but still representative.
