## Tentative Project Title

## Motivation for this project

The airline industry is highly dependent on timely flight operations,
and flight delays are a common concern for both passengers and airlines.
Weather conditions often play a big role in causing delays. In this
project, we aim to investigate the relationship between weather and
flight delays using historical flight data from 2013. By understanding
the data patterns, we would build a prediction model to predict flight
delays based on variables including but not limited to carriers,
airports, weather, etc. We would also assess if the insights gained from
2013 data can be applied to 2023, which is ten years later.
